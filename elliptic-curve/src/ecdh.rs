//! Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Support.
//!
//! This module contains a generic ECDH implementation which is usable with
//! any elliptic curve which implements the [`ProjectiveArithmetic`] trait (presently
//! the `k256` and `p256` crates)
//!
//! # ECDH Ephemeral (ECDHE) Usage
//!
//! Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman provides a one-time key exchange between two peers
//! using a randomly generated set of keys for each exchange.
//!
//! In practice ECDHE is used as part of an [Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE)][AKE]
//! protocol (e.g. [SIGMA]), where an existing cryptographic trust relationship
//! can be used to determine the authenticity of the ephemeral keys, such as
//! a digital signature. Without such an additional step, ECDHE is insecure!
//! (see security warning below)
//!
//! See the documentation for the [`EphemeralSecret`] type for more information
//! on performing ECDH ephemeral key exchanges.
//!
//! # Static ECDH Usage
//!
//! Static ECDH key exchanges are supported via the low-level
//! [`diffie_hellman`] function.
//!

///
/// Whenever possible, we recommend using the high-level ECDH ephemeral API
/// provided by [`EphemeralSecret`].
///
/// However, if you are implementing a protocol which requires a static scalar
/// value as part of an ECDH exchange, this API can be used to compute a
/// [`SharedSecret`] from that value.
///
/// Note that this API operates on the low-level [`NonZeroScalar`] and
/// [`AffinePoint`] types. If you are attempting to use the higher-level
/// [`SecretKey`][`crate::SecretKey`] and [`PublicKey`] types, you will
/// need to use the following conversions:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let shared_secret = elliptic_curve::ecdh::diffie_hellman(
///     secret_key.to_nonzero_scalar(),
///     public_key.as_affine()
/// );
/// ```

/// Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Secret.

/// These are ephemeral "secret key" values which are deliberately designed
/// to avoid being persisted.
///
/// To perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange, do the following:
///
/// - Have each participant generate an [`EphemeralSecret`] value
/// - Compute the [`PublicKey`] for that value
/// - Have each peer provide their [`PublicKey`] to their counterpart
/// - Use [`EphemeralSecret`] and the other participant's [`PublicKey`]
///   to compute a [`SharedSecret`] value.

/// Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchanges are unauthenticated and without a
/// further authentication step are trivially vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
/// attacks!

/// These exchanges should be performed in the context of a protocol which
/// takes further steps to authenticate the peers in a key exchange.
