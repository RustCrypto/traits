# We use an hpke commit that pulls in x25519-dalek v2.0.0-pre.1. This is necessary because all the
# modern crates (including this one) use zeroize >1.3, which is incompatible with the previous
# x25519-dalek version. Once the next x25519-dalek version is cut, the next hpke version will be
# cut, and this commit-based dependency can go away.
