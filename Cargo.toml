# Use crates.io patch instead of a `path = "../foo"` in each

# This allows to pull a git dependency from outside this workspace
# without having to also pull all the transitive dependencies from
# within this workspace.
# Otherwise, the transitive dependency gets duplicated and you end
# up with objects not implementing trait error that are hard to debug.
